# 3d printer

This is my DIY 3D printer project. In this project, I will use the parts from [prusa_bear](https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade).
As you know, not all the parts in the original prusa design are availble on your country, so I will design some custom parts for the components that avaiable at my country(VN)
